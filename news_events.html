                            A ten day NSS camp was held in the village of Ghokunte in Kolar District from 2nd January to
                            12th January. Sri. Vignesh Coordinator and NSS Programme Officer along with Sri Surabh Kamal
                            Social Work Coordinator has took in charge of the camp. Fr. Vinoo Fabian, the Manager
                            campus. The members of the camp had a great experience working with the people, listening to
                            the Panchayat members, cleaning drains, painting a government school and a bus stand.
                            Students also conducted a survey of the village, cooked and had fun. They return to the
                            college with deep love for the villagers being impressed by their simplicity and
                            cordiality.<br>
                            As the students arrived at 7:00 am in the college, we left to bus stop and started our
                            journey by 9:00 am and after a long journey to Mulabhagilu. We got into another bus to
                            Gokhunte and reached by 2:30pm and fresh up and had our lunch. Then settled down, had a nice
                            rest. Inauguration was supposed to be at 3:00pm but was cancelled and was postponed to the
                            next day. Afterwards we went to collect the firewood, by 5:00 pm began to cook had our tea
                            and at 7:40 had our dinner. At 8:30 began to discuss the day one and shared our experiences.
                            During the discussion three committee were formed and each committee was allotted respective
                            works and those works were rotated each day. Cooking committee, firewood collecting
                            committee and vessels washing. And after the discussion we went to bed by 10:00pm.
                            <br>
                            We had also learned a lot from the farmers and we realised how the farmers are working for
                            the food crops and providing and satisfying our hunger and need. But most of the times we
                            won’t realise their hard work, but until and unless we had worked along with them. We came
                            to know the hard work of the farmer and his thoughtfulness for all the people. If he says he
                            cannot work what will happen to all the people. We starve for hunger and besides we also
                            realised that this village people are very approachable and friendly when we speak with them
                            and they were so much helpful and We also must need to work very hard for the sake of others
                            or for the sake oneself to get good result for the work we do, whether it is study, work or
                            whatever it may be.

                        <p class="collapse text-justify" id="collapseExample2" aria-expanded="false">
                            On 3rd January was the unbelievable news for us the Lecturers, students, people and for the
                            Diocese of Bangalore to accept that our Principle Late Dr. Ambrose Pinto was no more. Though
                            it was a joy for the whole world to welcome the New Year 2018 but it was a sorrowful event
                            for us to give send off to our Principle from his Earthly life. In our collage we had
                            Memorial Service on 22.1. 2018. His Grace Dr. Bernard Mores the Archbishop of Bangalore was
                            present with us at the sorrowful moment. All our teaching and none –teaching staff, present
                            and old – students were gather to pay our tribute to our beloved Principle.<br>
                            It was heart breaking to hear the experiences of our lecturer and students old and present
                            which they had with our beloved Principle. Archbishop spoke few words about our Principle
                            and shared one of his experiences that; when Archbishop was having a talk with him he asked
                            to fix CCTV camera our Principle refused by saying “I do not want my students to be confined
                            with CCTV rather I wish my students to be free and to make use of their freedom in a
                            responsible way.<br>
                            His was a beautiful life and he loved everyone. He lived an inspiring life so we can say
                            that “His life was a Message”. He had contributed a lot to the world thus his smile always
                            reminds us that he is in our midst. His simple life style allowed everyone to approach him
                            at any hour of the day. He never minced his words; but he was never loud – his quality to be
                            soft-spoken made others to hear you and to follow his directions. He made sure that students
                            should have a “Vision for their future Mission.”

                        <p class="collapse text-justify" id="collapseExample3" aria-expanded="false">
                            Our students actively participated in the protest meet and rally on September 12th, against
                            the cold blooded murder of the activist-journalist Gauri Lankesh. This rally, organized by
                            the ‘Gauri Lankesh Hatya Virodhi Vedike’ (Forum against the Assassination of Gauri Lankesh),
                            had participants from over 100 progressive-secular organisations and educational
                            institutes.<br>
                            The massive and fierce rally with sea of emotional and angry protesters was carried out from
                            City Railway Station to the Central College; where the protesters sat and listened to the
                            speakers who had come from all over the country to express their solidarity. Medha Patkar,
                            Kavita Krishnan, Sitaram Yechury, P Sainath, Swami Agniwesh, Jignesh Mevani, Teesta
                            Setalwad, Prashant Bhushan, several other progressive-secular minds, social activists,
                            academicians, journalists and concerned citizens from film industry took their turn and
                            spoke to the gathering of thousands.<br>
                            The students joined the rally and the meet with handmade posters and placards with slogans
                            displaying their anguish and fearless demand for justice. With placards saying ‘I am Gauri’,
                            ‘we are Gauri’, ‘we shall fight, we shall win’; the message was loud and clear: ‘No’ to fear
                            and hatred.
                            Earlier, the day after her assassination on September 5th, our students were also part of
                            the protest meet and candle vigil at Town Hall against this cowardly and inhumane act. The
                            same day we also paid our last respect to Gauri Lankesh, whose body was kept in the Ravindra
                            Kalakshetra campus for the public to pay last homage.

                            The memorial lecture for our former Principal, Rev. Dr. Fr. Ambrose Pinto SJ, was organized
                            on13thJuly 2018 as a mark of our reverence and respect. The theme of the memorial lecture
                            was “The Power of Youth in Indian Politics.” The young leader and social activist, Jignesh
                            Mevani, MLA from Vadgam Constituency in Gujarat spoke powerfully on the theme of the
                            lecture.<br>
                            The memorial lecture started with a very informative speech by Saurabh Kamal from the
                            Department of Social Work. Later, the event was taken over by the chief guest, Jignesh who
                            quickly caught our attention with his humor and his realistic speech. He said, “He who can't
                            even love, can never start a revolution.” It was a single line, but it was important that we
                            understood its essence coming from the school of thought of Ambedkar.<br>
                            The entire topics that he covered were about the real questions the youth had. He ended his
                            speech with an invitation for us to visit his constituency.

                        <p class="collapse text-justify" id="collapseExample6" aria-expanded="false">
                            15th August 2018 marks the 72nd year of free India. India holds a lot of glory in recalling
                            its long brave struggle of breaking free from the chains of British rule. We do not just
                            celebrate this day because we broke out from the yolk of “British Raj”, but celebrate the
                            long struggle of 200 years of our people who watered this land with blood and sweat in order
                            to sow the seeds of independence.<br>
                            Even after all these years of freedom, the same question echoes from the depths of darkness:
                            “ARE WE REALLY FREE?” Yes, no doubt we as a nation got our independence. Yet are we, the
                            people of this land, free? The term “FREEDOM” is very subjective and different people have
                            different opinions on this topic. Whatever it is, one thing is for sure that freedom can
                            never be a destination. Rather, it is the struggle for independence that will grant you true
                            Independence. If you dare to speak, if you must question then freedom is yours. We started
                            the program by welcoming our chief guest, Colonel S. Kumar along with his wife Mira Kumari.
                            We began the programme with a prayer song followed by a skit on Bhagat Singh, a mime on
                            corruption, a patriotic song and group dance. The basic idea behind all the performances was
                            that “no country is great but the people make it great!”
                            At last, we ended on an inspiring note with a motivational speech by colonel S. Kumar, our
                            chief guest for the day.

                            The orientation program for the post-graduate students was conducted on 25th August, 2018.
                            The chief guest for the event was His Grace, Most Reverend Dr. Bernard Moras, Archbishop
                            Emeritus of the Archdiocese of Bangalore and former President of our college. His Grace was
                            accompanied by our beloved principal Sr. Philomena Cardoza and Fr. Bala Francis, Assistant

                            followed by the lighting of the lamp by the chief guest, the dignitaries and students. Fr.

                            Sr. Philomena Cardoza welcomed the new batch of students and encouraged them by stating
                            that, “A dream doesn’t become a reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and
                            hard work.” All the teaching and non-teaching staff members of the college were introduced
                            to the new students. Our chief guest, Most Reverend Dr. Bernard Moras addressed the
